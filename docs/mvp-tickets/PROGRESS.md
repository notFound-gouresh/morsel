## Sprint Release Notes Draft

### Sprint 00 - Foundation

Release type: internal only.

Expected user-facing change: none.

Message: Core app infrastructure is being prepared so accounts, workspaces, database records, and future feed workflows are reliable.

### Sprint 01 - Feed Engine Core

Release type: internal only.

Expected user-facing change: none.

Message: The feed engine can safely validate URLs, fetch public documents, parse native RSS/Atom feeds, fingerprint items, and render feed outputs internally.

### Sprint 02 - Discovery and Creation APIs

Release type: internal/API preview.

Expected user-facing change: technical testers may be able to create and inspect feeds through APIs.

Message: URL-to-feed creation is available behind the scenes, including preview, save, item storage, and RSS/JSON/CSV endpoints.

### Sprint 03 - User Dashboard

Release type: private alpha.

Expected user-facing change: early users can sign up, create a feed from a URL, preview items, save feeds, and copy output links.

Message: Private alpha is open for creating your first feeds and using RSS, JSON, and CSV links.

### Sprint 04 - Refresh Jobs

Release type: alpha update.

Expected user-facing change: saved feeds refresh automatically, users can manually refresh, and feed health is visible.

Message: Feeds now update automatically and show refresh status, making Morsel usable for real monitoring workflows.

### Sprint 05 - Filters and Production Hardening

Release type: MVP beta.

Expected user-facing change: users can filter noisy feed items, see better errors, and rely on a more stable beta product.

Message: MVP beta is ready with feed creation, auto-refresh, output links, basic filtering, safer rate limits, and production readiness checks.

## Blockers

No blockers recorded. S00-T02 is complete, and its initial migration is applied to the configured PostgreSQL database. S00-T03 can use the configured `SESSION_SECRET`, `APP_URL`, and `DATABASE_URL`.

## Decisions

- Use strict TypeScript and ESLint from the foundation sprint, gated through `bun run check`. Type/lint errors are the main automated check given lighter human review on this project. See `S00-T01b`.
- Run `next typegen` before `tsc --noEmit` so standalone type checks always validate freshly generated Next.js route types rather than depending on existing `.next` output.
- Run tests via Node's native TypeScript type stripping (Node 24+); no `ts-node`/`tsx` needed.
- Pin `typescript` to `~5.9.0` — TypeScript 7 breaks `typescript-eslint@8`. See `S00-T01b`.
- ESLint config is `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` + `typescript-eslint` recommended, not hand-picked plugins. See `S00-T01b`.
- Pin `eslint` to `~9.39.0` — ESLint 10 breaks `eslint-plugin-react` (pulled in via `eslint-config-next`). See `S00-T01b`.
- Use PostgreSQL plus Prisma for the MVP database path.
- Pin Prisma ORM and Prisma Client to `6.19.3` for the established Node client runtime used by this ticket. Prisma CLI configuration loads `.env.local` only when `DATABASE_URL` is not already provided by the environment.
- Use PostgreSQL `citext` for case-insensitive email uniqueness. The initial migration enables the extension before creating email columns.
- Enforce matching feed and workspace IDs for feed items, feed filters, and refresh jobs with composite foreign keys to prevent cross-workspace records.
- Database tests create uniquely named records, remove them after each suite, and load `.env.local` only when it exists so CI-provided environment variables remain supported.
- Use database-backed refresh jobs for MVP before adding Redis/BullMQ.
- Keep keyword/topic feed creation out of strict MVP; consider Google News keyword feeds as a post-MVP or MVP+ ticket.
- Keep advanced integrations out of strict MVP until feed creation, refresh, filtering, and outputs are production-ready.
