# Morsel Product Requirements: RSS.app-Like Feed Generation SaaS

Date: 2026-07-08

Owner: Product, architecture, engineering

Scope: A production SaaS that turns websites, native RSS/Atom feeds, newsletters, search/topic sources, and selected social/platform sources into reliable feeds, widgets, alerts, webhooks, and developer-friendly outputs.

Non-goal for v1: AI brief generation, AI summarization, and autonomous insight extraction. These can be future add-on modules after the feed engine, delivery surfaces, limits, and monitoring are dependable.

## Evidence Base

This document uses public product and documentation evidence as the boundary for RSS.app parity. It intentionally separates "observed competitor capability" from "recommended implementation."

Primary RSS.app sources:

- RSS.app Visual RSS Builder page documents the workflow: load website, point and click title/image/description elements, preview items, generate feed, support JavaScript-heavy pages, and manual refresh: https://rss.app/rss-feed/rss-builder
- RSS.app generator guide documents XML, JSON, CSV outputs, scheduled fetch, item identification, deduplication, endpoint refresh, retries, stable feed URLs, JS rendering, and public-page limitation: https://rss.app/guides/rss-generator
- RSS.app widget guide documents widgets as dynamic feed display surfaces using feed URLs, generated feeds, native feeds, bundled feeds, async externally hosted embeds, layout formats, and responsive customization: https://rss.app/guides/rss-widgets
- RSS.app bots guide documents feed-to-channel delivery to Slack, Discord, Telegram, and email: https://rss.app/guides/rss-bots
- RSS.app bundles page documents merging feeds, filtering, widgets, and alerts for bundles: https://rss.app/feed-bundles
- RSS.app newsletter page documents private signup email addresses, newsletter catalog, bundles, widgets, collections, and filtering: https://rss.app/tools/newsletter-to-rss-feed-email-feed
- RSS.app JSON and CSV tool pages document preview, save, one-click export, multiple formats, and API/workflow usage: https://rss.app/tools/rss-to-json and https://rss.app/tools/rss-to-csv

## 1. Product Summary

Morsel lets users create dependable machine-readable feeds from web pages, existing RSS/Atom feeds, newsletters, search/topic sources, and selected social/platform URLs, then reuse those feeds as RSS, JSON, CSV, widgets, webhooks, alerts, and API data.

In simple language: users paste a URL or choose a source, Morsel detects or builds a feed, keeps it refreshed, filters noise, removes duplicates, and sends updates where the user needs them.

Target customers:

- Marketers and PR teams monitoring brands, competitors, campaigns, and media mentions.
- Researchers, analysts, legal, policy, VC, security, and finance teams tracking external signals.
- Agencies building client dashboards, social walls, and content hubs.
- Developers needing normalized feed data, webhooks, JSON, CSV, and APIs.
- Internal communications teams piping company, customer, social, and industry updates into Slack, Discord, Telegram, email, intranets, or websites.

Core value proposition:

- Convert messy changing web content into reliable structured feeds.
- Control what gets through using filters, deduplication, curation, and limits.
- Deliver updates to humans, websites, and systems without manual checking.
- Make the product billable, monitorable, secure, and operable at SaaS scale.

### Competitive Positioning

Morsel should not begin as a broad personal RSS reader. The market evidence suggests three adjacent categories:

| Product | Observed strengths | Product lesson for Morsel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RSS.app | Feed generation, visual builder, widgets, bots, bundles, filters, exports, API/webhooks, pricing-gated limits | Primary parity target for a generator and delivery SaaS |
| Feedly | Reader, newsletters, Google News, boards, search, teams, enterprise intelligence | Good inspiration for saved views and team organization, but not the v1 wedge |
| Inoreader | Reader plus filters/rules, web feeds, track changes, newsletters, social feeds, API/custom tiers | Strong reference for power-user filtering and monitoring workflows |
| FetchRSS | Visual builder, auto-updated generated feeds, unique feed URLs, social URL feeds, RSS/Atom/JSON/CSV, filters | Direct generator competitor; proves point-and-click builder expectations |
| RSSHub | Open-source route-based source adapters for many platforms | Useful architectural pattern for platform-specific sources and community routes |
| FiveFilters | CSS-selector feed creation, RSS/JSON outputs, managed custom feeds | Useful for advanced selector mode and custom managed feed services |
| Zapier RSS | RSS triggers and feed item creation inside workflow automation | Morsel should integrate with Zapier/Make rather than trying to replace them |
| IFTTT RSS | Simple applet triggers for RSS/Atom to notifications/email | Morsel should provide clean feeds and webhooks that these tools can consume |
| RSS API | Feed parser/subscription API with webhooks, validation, detection, combine, pricing by subscriptions/parses | Reference for developer API packaging and usage-based limits |

Recommended approach:

1. Build a feed-generation SaaS first: URL to feed, native feed support, parser, scheduler, output endpoints, filters, dashboard.
2. Add delivery surfaces second: widgets, webhooks, Slack/Discord/Telegram/email, API keys.
3. Add advanced builder and platform adapters after core reliability: visual selector recipes, social-specific sources, teams, admin, enterprise.

Alternative approaches considered:

- Reader-first: faster UI value, but competes directly with mature readers and delays the harder differentiated engine.
- API-first only: attractive to developers, but misses no-code users and widget/bot revenue.
- Widget-first: visible and marketable, but widgets depend on reliable feeds and filters.

Recommendation: engine-first with no-code surfaces. This maximizes product defensibility and keeps every later surface powered by the same feed truth.

## 5. Suggested Tech Stack

| Layer | Recommendation | Why suitable | Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js, React, TypeScript | Existing repo is Next; good for dashboard, public endpoints, auth, server components | Remix, SvelteKit |
| Backend API | Next.js route handlers initially, migrate heavy services to NestJS/Fastify workers | Keeps MVP fast while allowing worker separation | FastAPI, Rails, Django |
| Database | PostgreSQL with Prisma or Drizzle | Relational multi-tenant SaaS data, JSONB for recipes/configs, indexes | MySQL, CockroachDB, Neon/Supabase managed Postgres |
| Queue | BullMQ on Redis for MVP; Temporal for complex workflows later | Simple jobs, retries, priorities; Temporal better for long-running durability | Cloud Tasks, SQS, Sidekiq |
| Caching | Redis plus CDN | Rate limits, locks, output cache, widget payload cache | Upstash Redis, KeyDB, Cloudflare KV |
| Object storage | S3-compatible storage | Snapshots, exports, screenshots, media proxy cache | Cloudflare R2, GCS, Azure Blob |
| Browser automation | Playwright in isolated worker pool | JS-rendered pages, visual builder, screenshots | Browserless, Playwright on Kubernetes, Crawlee |
| Feed parsing | `feedparser`, `rss-parser`, `htmlparser2`, `cheerio`, `readability` as needed | Mature parsing/extraction ecosystem | Python `feedparser`, Go feed parsers |
| Search/indexing | Postgres full-text for MVP, Meilisearch/OpenSearch later | Search feed items/admin logs as scale grows | Typesense, Elasticsearch |
| Billing | Stripe | Checkout, subscriptions, customer portal, webhooks | Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, Chargebee |
| Authentication | Auth.js/NextAuth or Clerk | Fast SaaS auth, OAuth, sessions; Clerk speeds teams/MFA | Supabase Auth, WorkOS for enterprise |
| Email | Resend or Postmark | Transactional email and digests | SendGrid, SES |
| Inbound email | Mailgun Routes or Postmark Inbound | Newsletter-to-RSS parsing | SES Inbound, SendGrid Inbound Parse |
| Observability | Sentry, OpenTelemetry, Grafana/Prometheus, structured logs | Error tracking plus worker/API traces | Datadog, New Relic |
| Deployment | Vercel for web, Fly.io/Render/Kubernetes for workers and browser pool | Separate web and long-running workloads | AWS ECS/Fargate, GCP Cloud Run |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions with lint/test/build/migrations | Standard deploy gate | Vercel CI, Buildkite |

Architecture choice:

- Keep the dashboard and public feed endpoints in Next.js for MVP.
- Run crawler, parser, browser, webhook, notification, and digest jobs as separate worker processes. Do not put crawling in request-response paths beyond short preview jobs.
- Treat the feed engine as a domain service with an internal API so it can be split out later.

## 7. API Design

Principles:

- REST is sufficient for v1 because resources are clear and external developers expect feed/webhook APIs. GraphQL is unnecessary initially and adds auth, caching, and N+1 complexity. Consider GraphQL only for internal admin dashboards if REST becomes cumbersome.
- All authenticated API routes require workspace context via session or `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`.
- Public endpoints can be public, unlisted, or tokenized private URLs.
- Standard errors: `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "details": {} } }`.
- Standard pagination: `limit`, `cursor` preferred for new APIs; support `offset` only where useful for admin exports.
- Rate-limit headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `Retry-After`.

## 8. Feed Generation Engine

### Pipeline

1. Accept input:
   - URL, native feed URL, visual recipe, platform source, newsletter address, or search query.
2. Normalize and validate:
   - Parse URL with a standards-compliant parser.
   - Resolve redirects with max redirect count.
   - Block private IPs, loopback, link-local, metadata endpoints, internal hostnames, unusual schemes, and DNS rebinding.
   - Enforce HTTP/HTTPS only.
3. Robots and policy:
   - Fetch and cache `robots.txt` by host where applicable.
   - Respect disallow rules for crawler behavior. RFC 9309 notes robots rules are not authorization, but they are a crucial product trust and blocklist policy.
   - Apply terms/adapter restrictions for platform sources.
4. Discover:
   - Check `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml|atom+xml|json">`.
   - Try common feed paths.
   - Parse sitemap URLs for likely recent content pages.
   - Detect page metadata and repeated item patterns.
5. Fetch:
   - Static HTTP fetch first with user-agent, timeout, content length limit, compression handling.
   - Conditional GET for native feeds using ETag and Last-Modified.
   - Browser render only when configured or required.
6. Extract:
   - Native parser for RSS/Atom/RDF/JSON Feed.
   - HTML auto-extractor for repeated cards/articles.
   - Visual selector recipe if present.
   - Platform adapter parser if source is classified.
7. Normalize:
   - Title, link, canonical URL, description text/html, image, author, date published, date modified, raw fields.
   - Clean HTML and strip scripts.
   - Resolve relative URLs.
8. Fingerprint:
   - Prefer canonical URL + source.
   - Fall back to source GUID.
   - Fall back to normalized title + date + source hash.
   - Store content hash for changed item detection.
9. Deduplicate:
   - Exact fingerprint dedup.
   - Similarity dedup using normalized title and canonical URL.
   - Bundle-level cross-feed dedup.
10. Date extraction:
   - Native dates first.
   - JSON-LD/OpenGraph/article metadata second.
   - DOM selector dates third.
   - Relative dates parsed in source timezone when known.
   - If missing, use `first_seen_at` and flag low confidence.
11. Image extraction:
   - Native enclosure/media fields first.
   - OpenGraph/Twitter image second.
   - DOM image selector third.
   - Validate type/size through proxy before widget use.
12. Filters:
   - Workspace global filters.
   - Feed filters.
   - Bundle filters if building bundle output.
   - Missing-field filters.
13. Store:
   - Upsert items by feed and fingerprint.
   - Mark changed items when content hash changes.
   - Preserve raw snapshot references for diagnostics.
14. Render:
   - Invalidate feed/bundle/widget caches.
   - Generate or lazily serve RSS/JSON/CSV.
15. Deliver:
   - Create events for webhooks, alerts, digests, widget cache refresh.
16. Observe:
   - Record job metrics, source latency, items found/new/changed, error class, next refresh.

### Refresh Scheduling

- Free plan: 24-hour refresh minimum.
- Starter: 120-minute refresh minimum.
- Developer and Pro: 15-minute minimum for normal feeds.
- Enterprise: custom intervals after cost and abuse review.
- Manual refresh uses a separate quota to prevent queue abuse.
- Failed jobs use exponential backoff and stop after repeated failures until next scheduled window or user action.

### Broken Feed Detection

Mark feed as:

- `degraded`: fetch succeeds but fewer fields/items than expected.
- `failed`: repeated fetch/extraction failure.
- `paused`: user or billing stopped jobs.
- `active`: recent successful refresh.

Notify user when:

- A feed fails N consecutive times.
- A visual selector recipe drops below minimum item match count.
- A source returns login/captcha/block page.
- Webhook or alert delivery is repeatedly failing.

### Handling Blocked Websites

- Do not bypass paywalls, logins, captchas, or anti-bot protections.
- Offer user alternatives: native feed discovery, official API integration, visual builder, lower refresh rate, or manual source exclusion.
- Maintain per-host request limits and blocklist.

### Legal and Robots Considerations

- Respect robots.txt and source terms as product policy.
- Store only metadata/snippets needed for feed outputs unless the user has rights to more.
- Keep source attribution and canonical links.
- Do not remove copyright notices from original content.
- Provide abuse report flow and takedown process.

## 9. Visual RSS Builder

### UX Flow

1. User selects "Visual Builder" and enters URL.
2. Backend validates URL and starts a builder session.
3. Browser worker loads page in isolated environment.
4. Frontend shows preview screenshot/interactive DOM proxy.
5. User selects repeated item container or clicks a representative post.
6. User maps fields: title, link, image, description, date, author.
7. System proposes selectors and highlights all matching items.
8. User reviews extracted preview.
9. User tests selectors.
10. User saves recipe as a feed source.
11. Refresh workers re-run recipe on schedule.
12. If selector match count or field quality changes, feed becomes degraded and user is notified.

### Technical Design

- Use Playwright worker pool.
- Never let arbitrary target pages run inside the main app origin.
- Prefer screenshot plus DOM metadata overlay for selection, or sandboxed iframe on a separate builder origin.
- Record selector candidates:
  - CSS selector.
  - XPath fallback only if needed.
  - Text/attribute hints.
  - Parent container selector.
  - Minimum/maximum item count expectations.
- Test selectors on current DOM before save.
- Store recipe as versioned JSON:
  - `containerSelector`
  - `fieldSelectors`
  - `renderJs`
  - `waitForSelector`
  - `scrollStrategy`
  - `dateParsingHints`
  - `qualityThresholds`

### Security Concerns

- SSRF controls before browser navigation.
- Isolated browser network egress.
- Block internal IP resolution after redirects and DNS changes.
- Disable downloads.
- Block file, ftp, chrome, and extension schemes.
- Time and memory limits per session.
- Sanitize all extracted HTML.
- Do not proxy authenticated user cookies to target sites.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Builder can generate a feed from a static article listing page.
- Builder can generate a feed from a JS-rendered listing when `renderJs` is enabled.
- User can see exactly which fields will be extracted before saving.
- Broken selector detection produces a clear degraded state.

## 10. Widget System

### Widget Builder UI

Screens:

- Select source: feed, bundle, collection.
- Select layout: feed, list, news wall, carousel, ticker, image board, magazine.
- Configure display: item count, title, date, author, image, description, source badge.
- Style: font family, text color, background, accent, spacing, border, radius, columns.
- Advanced: custom CSS, UTM tags, affiliate tags, allowed domains.
- Preview: desktop, tablet, mobile.
- Publish: copy script embed and iframe fallback.
- Analytics: views, clicks, CTR, top domains, top items.

### Public Widget Endpoint

- `GET /embed/widget/{publicId}.js` returns small async loader.
- Loader creates shadow DOM or iframe depending on config and host capabilities.
- Loader fetches widget payload from CDN-backed endpoint.
- Payload contains sanitized item data and style config.

### Iframe vs Script

Script approach:

- Pros: Better responsive integration and styling.
- Cons: CSP issues, host CSS collision unless shadow DOM.

Iframe approach:

- Pros: Strong isolation and safer custom CSS.
- Cons: Height resizing complexity and less native page integration.

Recommendation:

- Default to script + shadow DOM.
- Provide iframe fallback for strict sites and custom CSS-heavy widgets.

### Caching

- CDN cache widget JS long-term by version.
- Widget payload short TTL, stale-while-revalidate.
- Invalidate on feed/bundle/collection update and widget config change.

### Styling Isolation

- Shadow DOM for script widgets.
- CSS variables for theme config.
- Custom CSS only inside iframe or constrained shadow root.

### Analytics

- Count view when widget payload is rendered.
- Count click through redirect endpoint or event beacon.
- Hash IP/user agent; avoid invasive tracking.
- Aggregate daily metrics.

### Abuse Protection

- Allowed domain enforcement.
- Per-widget rate limits.
- Referrer validation where possible.
- Public widget traffic anomaly detection.
- Kill switch for abusive widgets.

### Performance Targets

- Loader JS under 15 KB gzipped for v1.
- Widget first content under 800 ms p95 from CDN on cached payload.
- Feed output endpoint under 300 ms p95 cached.
- No synchronous blocking on host page render.

## 11. Integrations

- OPML export includes current workspace feeds and bundles where representable.

Acceptance:

- Import reports created/skipped/failed rows.

## 12. Billing and Plans

This plan system is inspired by RSS.app limits but adapted for a new SaaS. Public plan packaging should remain flexible until infrastructure costs are measured.

| Limit | Free | Starter | Developer | Pro | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Price | $0 | $12/mo | $29/mo | $99/mo | Custom |

| Keyword filters | basic 5 | 25 | 100 | 500 | custom |
| Advanced filter rules | no | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Bundles | no | 5 | 25 | 100 | custom |
| Collections | 1, 10 items | 5, 50 items | 25, 250 items | 100, 1000 items | custom |
| Newsletter feeds | no | 2 | 20 | 100 | custom |
| Visual builder | no | limited | yes | yes | custom |
| Social adapters | no | selected | selected | more + priority | custom/legal review |
| Branding | Morsel link | removable | removable | removable | custom |
| Support | docs | email | priority email | priority + diagnostics | SLA |

Trial logic:

- Starter/Developer/Pro trials require payment method.
- Trial creates entitlements immediately.
- Trial ending without payment success downgrades to Free grace mode.
- Trial abuse checks: domain, payment fingerprint, email/domain, IP risk.

Upgrade behavior:

- Immediate entitlement increase.
- Refresh intervals can be recalculated immediately.
- Existing jobs keep their current run state.

Downgrade behavior:

- Do not delete feeds/widgets.
- Mark resources above limit as inactive in a user-controlled order, defaulting to oldest inactive/least recently used.
- Keep data read-only for 30 days before archival policy.

Over-limit handling:

- Soft warnings at 80 percent.
- Hard block for creating new resources beyond plan.
- For usage metrics, throttle API and manual refresh.
- For public widgets, continue serving cached content during billing grace period, then show branded inactive state.

Usage tracking:

- Metrics: feed count, scheduled refreshes, manual refreshes, browser-render minutes, API operations, webhook deliveries, alert deliveries, widget views, CSV exports, storage.
- Roll up hourly and monthly.

## 13. Security, Compliance, and Abuse Prevention

### Authentication Security

- Strong password hashing.
- Email verification.
- MFA for paid teams.
- Secure HTTP-only cookies.
- Session revocation.
- Audit logs for security events.

### API Key Security

- Display key once.
- Store hash only.
- Prefix for lookup.
- Scopes and expiration.

- HMAC SHA-256 over `${timestamp}.${raw_body}`.
- Reject timestamps outside 300 seconds.
- Use timing-safe comparison.

### SSRF Protection

- Parse URLs using standard library, not regex.
- Allow only HTTP/HTTPS.
- Resolve DNS and block private, loopback, link-local, multicast, reserved, metadata IPs.
- Re-check IP after redirects.
- Protect against DNS rebinding.
- Block custom ports unless allowlisted.
- Fetch from isolated network egress.

### URL Fetching Restrictions

- Max redirects.
- Max response size.
- Connect/read timeouts.

- Robots policy.
- Per-host rate limits.
- No user-provided headers except controlled allowlist.

### Rate Limiting

- Login by IP/email.
- API by key/workspace.
- Manual refresh by workspace/feed.
- Fetches by host and source type.
- Public endpoints by IP/feed/widget.
- Webhook delivery by destination.

### Bot Detection and Trial Abuse

- Signup risk scoring.
- CAPTCHA only when risk is high.
- Disposable email/domain controls.
- Payment fingerprint checks.
- Abuse reports and source/domain blocklists.

### Scraping Abuse Controls

- No paywall/login/captcha bypass.
- Do not support credentialed scraping in v1.
- Respect robots policy.
- Per-host crawl budget.
- User-agent identification with contact URL.

### Data Privacy

### Copyright and Content Concerns

- Store metadata/snippets by default.
- Link to original source.
- Do not present copied full text as owned content.
- Provide takedown workflow.
- Let users hide/remove items.

### Terms of Service Concerns

- Terms must prohibit illegal scraping, credential sharing, paywall bypass, spam, and surveillance abuse.
- Platform adapters require terms review before launch.

### Logging and Audit Trails

- Audit user/admin/security/billing changes.
- Log crawler errors without leaking secrets.
- Redact tokens, cookies, email bodies where unnecessary.

## 14. Admin Panel

Admin features:

- User management: search users, status, email verification, security events.
- Workspace management: plan, usage, members, status, abuse flags.
- Feed/job monitoring: refresh history, queue state, fetch status, parser output, item counts.
- Failed feed diagnostics: HTTP status, robots result, extraction result, selector match counts, screenshots where safe.
- Plan/subscription management: current Stripe status, invoices, entitlement overrides.
- Abuse reports: domains, users, workspaces, blocked hosts, public widget abuse.
- System usage dashboard: feed count, job throughput, browser minutes, widget views, webhook deliveries.
- Queue health: queue depth, lag, failure rate, worker heartbeat.
- Crawl error logs: grouped by host, code, adapter, workspace.
- Webhook delivery logs: status, attempt, response, next retry.
- Support impersonation with audit logs: reason required, time-limited, visible to admins, no secret access.

Acceptance criteria:

- Support can resolve common feed failures from UI.
- Admin actions are audited.
- Abuse blocks take effect in fetcher before network request.

Open questions before development:

1. Which customer segment is first: marketers/agencies, developers, or researchers?
2. Should Morsel use a managed auth provider or own Auth.js from the start?
3. Which deployment target is preferred for browser workers: Fly.io, Render, ECS, or Kubernetes?
4. Are social adapters required for launch, or can launch focus on native feeds, webpages, newsletters, and Google News?
5. What legal stance should we take on robots.txt disallow: hard block, warning, or enterprise-configurable policy?
6. Should public feed/widget URLs be branded with `morsel.app` or customer custom domains?
7. What content retention policy is acceptable for feed items, raw snapshots, screenshots, and newsletter email bodies?
8. Do we need SOC 2 readiness in year one?
9. What is the desired free-plan generosity given crawler and browser-rendering costs?
10. Should visual builder be Stage 8 as planned, or is it required in MVP for differentiation?
